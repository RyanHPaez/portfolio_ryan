          <p>
            I am father of two perfect children and a husband to the best wife
            in the world. Currently working as a Aircraft Mechanic at Western
            Jet Aviation in Van Nuys, CA. I love staying busy, focused and
            challenged and am a excellent team player with a great personality,
            with amazing drive and am very persistent. When I found coding I
            learned that it fits into what I am a natural at. Never giving up!
            Constantly being challenged is something I love. I see my future as
            being happy and thankful for always wanting to do better.
          </p>
