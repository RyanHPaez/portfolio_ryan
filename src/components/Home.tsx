            <p>
              I am a father of two perfect children and a husband to the best
              wife in the world. Currently working as a Aircraft Mechanic at
              Western Jet Aviation in Van Nuys, CA. Love staying busy, focused
              and challenged, being very persistent with amazing drive. An
              excellent team player with a great personality, easy to talk to
              and also known to be a genuine guy. Coding found me and I learned
              that it fits into what I am a natural at. Never giving up! My
              present and future is blessed with happiness that comes from
              having a positive attitude. Proud of all accomplishments achieved
              and future accomplishments that will be achieved. Wanting to
              mature will always be a thing for me.
